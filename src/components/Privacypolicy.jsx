                A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on
                your computer’s hard drive. Once you agree, the file is added
                and the cookie helps analyze web traffic or lets you know when
                you visit a particular site. Cookies allow web applications to
                respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor
                its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering
                and remembering information about your preferences. <br />
                We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being
                used. This helps us analyze data about web page traffic and
                improve our Website in order to tailor it to customer needs. We
                only use this information for statistical analysis purposes and
                then the data is removed from the system. <br />
                Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better Website, by
                enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you
                do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or
                any information about you, other than the data you choose to
                share with us. <br />
                You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers
                automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your
                browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may
                prevent you from taking full advantage of the Website.
